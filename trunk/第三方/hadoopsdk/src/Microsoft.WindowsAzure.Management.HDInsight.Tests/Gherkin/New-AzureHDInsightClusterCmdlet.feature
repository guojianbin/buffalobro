Feature: New-AzureHDInsightCluster Cmdlet
		 In order to manage my HDInsight clusters on my Azure subscription
		 As an IT professional
		  I want to be able to execute a PowerShell command that creates an HDInsight cluster

Background: I have setup the Cmdlets
  	  Given I have installed the AzureHDInsight Cmdlets
       When I am using the "New-AzureHDInsightCluster" PowerShell Cmdlet

Scenario: There Exists a Remove-AzureHDInsightCluster PowerShell Cmdlet
	 Then There exists a "New-AzureHDInsightCluster" PowerShell Cmdlet

Scenario: There is only 1 ParameterSet specified for the Get-AzureHDInsightCluster PowerShell Cmdlet
	 Then there exists a "Cluster By Name (with Specific Subscription Credentials)" parameter set
	  And there exists a "Cluster By Config (with Specific Subscription Credentials)" parameter set
	  And there exists no further parameter sets

Scenario Outline: No parameter set has two parameters in the same location
	  And I am using the "<ParameterSetName>" parameter set
	 Then no parameter in the set shares the same position with another parameter from the set
Examples: 
| ParameterSetName                                           |
| Cluster By Name (with Specific Subscription Credentials)   |
| Cluster By Config (with Specific Subscription Credentials) |

Scenario Outline: No parameter set has two parameters that accept their value from the pipeline
	  And I am using the "<ParameterSetName>" parameter set
	 Then only one parameter in the set is set to take its value from the pipeline
Examples: 
| ParameterSetName                                           |
| Cluster By Name (with Specific Subscription Credentials)   |
| Cluster By Config (with Specific Subscription Credentials) |

Scenario: No parameter in any set shares a name or alias with another
	 Then no parameter in any parameter set shares a name or alias with another parameter

Scenario: No parameter lacks either a Getter or a Setter
	 Then no parameter lacks either a Getter or a Setter

Scenario: I can use the "Cluster By Name (with Specific Subscription Credentials)" parameter set
	 When I am using the "Cluster By Name (with Specific Subscription Credentials)" parameter set
	 Then there exists a "Name" Cmdlet parameter
	  And   it is of type "String"
